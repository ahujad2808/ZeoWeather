# Weather Sense

</div>

This repository contains a full-stack project developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that fetches local weather data from weather API and displays it on the dashboard.

## Frontend
The frontend is built with React and is responsible for rendering and routing various sub-components, including the dashboard page, welcome page, and login/register pages. These pages are designed using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Axios library is utilized to make GET/POST requests to fetch data from the Weather API and communicate with the MongoDB database.

## Backend
The backend consists of Express.js and Node.js, which act as a bridge between the React frontend and the database. It facilitates the retrieval of weather data by making API requests through Express's GET/POST functionality. 

The MongoDB database, hosted on MongoDB Atlas, is utilized to store two collections: one for active users (those currently logged in) and another for registered users. The registered users collection contains details such as name, email, password, and city.
